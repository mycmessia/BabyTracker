# BabyTracker
This is a C++ console tool to tracker baby actions.

Currently it supports adding
1. Sleep Sessions
2. Breast Feed Sessions
3. Bottle Feed Sessions
4. Nappy Change Sessions
5. Boild Water Sessions

I'm in the process of adding query features so it's easy to check e.g. how many times we have fed the baby today.

I created this to familiarize myself with C++ stuff during my paternity leave for our first little one.
